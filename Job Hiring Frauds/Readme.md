<summary>Scam in the name of Naukri.com</summary>
<br>
Description <br>
Yesterday, I received an email informing me that I had been selected for an internship I had applied for. The email requested me to send my resume, and without realizing it, I sent it. After that, I received a few more emails from different individuals stating that I had been selected. Unfortunately, I didn't notice those emails.

Today, I received a call from someone at Naukri, who mentioned that I hadn't been responding to companies and didn't have a job ID. They informed me that because I hadn't read the terms and policies of Naukri.com
, the company would take legal action against me and issue a challan of Rs. 48,000. I was confused because I had applied to several companies, but this situation seemed quite strange.

The caller spoke about the potential harm to my family's reputation and the possibility of a seven-year ban on my documents. Naturally, like anyone who hears about a ban on their achievements for no reason, I became worried.

The caller proposed a solution, suggesting that I pay Rs. 7,400 while staying on the call to cancel the challan. I decided to put the call on hold. <br>
